# humilis
Helps you deploy AWS infrastructure (based on the cumulus project)

This project is heavily based on
[cumulus](https://github.com/germangh/cumulus/blob/master/cumulus/__init__.py). 
I decided to create a new repository instead of forking the cumulus project
because I am planning to make some major changes that will break backwards 
compatibility. Also, the development of cumulus seems to have stopped 
and their maintainers are not merging pull requests all that quickly. The 
original cumulus licence is included in file CUMULUS_LICENSE.
